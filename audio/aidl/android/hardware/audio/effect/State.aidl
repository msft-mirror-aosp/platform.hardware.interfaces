     * 2. Be able to handle all parameter setting with IEffect.setParameter().

     * An effect instance is in PROCESSING state after it receive an START command and start
     * processing data successfully. Effect instance will transfer from PROCESSING to IDLE state if
     * it receive an STOP or RESET command and handle the command successfully.
     *
     * When an instance is in PROCESSING state, client should try not to close() it directly,
     * instead client should try to stop processing data first with STOP command before close(). In
     * the case of a close() call received when instance in PROCESSING state, it should try to stop
     * processing and transfer to IDLE first before close().
     *
     * **Requirements in PROCESSING state:**
     * 1. Return EX_ILLEGAL_STATE if it's not able to handle any parameter settings at runtime.
     * 2. Be able to handle STOP and RESET for IEffect.command() interface, and return
     * EX_ILLEGAL_STATE for all other commands.
     * 3. Must be able to handle all get* interface calls like IEffect.getParameter() and
     * IEffect.getState().
     *
     * **State Transitions:**
     * - Transitions to **IDLE** on `IEffect.command(CommandId.STOP)` ( if no draining is required
     *   or implemented) or `IEffect.command(CommandId.RESET)`.
     * - Transitions to **DRAINING** on `IEffect.command(CommandId.STOP)` if draining is required.
     * - Remains in **PROCESSING** on `IEffect.getParameter()`, `IEffect.setParameter()`,
     *   `IEffect.getDescriptor()`, and `IEffect.reopen()`.
     *
     * **Notes:**
     * - Clients should avoid calling `IEffect.close()` directly in this state; instead, they should
     *   stop processing with `CommandId.STOP` before closing.
     * - If `IEffect.close()` is called in this state, the effect instance should stop processing,
     *   transition to **IDLE**, and then close.

     * draining is required.

     * **Requirements in DRAINING state:**
     * 1. Must handle `CommandId.START` and transition back to **PROCESSING**.
     * 2. Must handle getter interface calls like `IEffect.getParameter()` and `IEffect.getState()`.
     * 3. Must automatically transition to **IDLE** after draining is complete.
     *
     * **State Transitions:**
     * - Transitions to **PROCESSING** on `IEffect.command(CommandId.START)`.
     * - Transitions to **IDLE** on `IEffect.command(CommandId.RESET)`.
     * - Transitions to **IDLE** automatically after draining is complete.
     * - Remains in **DRAINING** on `IEffect.getParameter()`, `IEffect.setParameter()`,
     *   `IEffect.getDescriptor()`, and `IEffect.reopen()`.

     * **Notes:**
     * - If not implemented, the effect instance may transition directly from **PROCESSING** to
     *   **IDLE** without this intermediate state.
     * - Any `CommandId.STOP` commands received during **DRAINING** should be ignored.
