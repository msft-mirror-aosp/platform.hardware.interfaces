     * of the property.
     *
     * For example, if a property is defined as READ_WRITE, but the OEM wants to specify certain

     * others must be set to READ_WRITE. We do not support setting specific area Ids to WRITE-only

     * VehiclePropConfig.areaConfigs, excluding those with access == VehiclePropertyAccess.NONE. For
     * example, if a VehiclePropConfig has some area configs with an access of
     * VehiclePropertyAccess.READ and others with an access of VehiclePropertyAccess.READ_WRITE, the
     * VehiclePropConfig object's access should be VehiclePropertyAccess.READ.
     *
     * In the scenario where the OEM actually wants to set VehicleAreaConfig.access =
     * VehiclePropertyAccess.NONE, the maximal subset rule should apply with this area config
     * included, making the VehiclePropConfig.access = VehiclePropertyAccess.NONE.

     *
     * If variable update rate is supported and 'enableVariableUpdateRate' is true in subscribe
     * options, VHAL must only sends property update event when the property's value changes
     * (a.k.a treat continuous as an on-change property).
     *
     * E.g. if the client is subscribing at 5hz at time 0. If the property's value is 0 initially
     * and becomes 1 after 1 second.

     * If variable update rate is not enabled, VHAL clients will receive 5 property change events
     * with value 0 and 5 events with value 1 after 2 seconds.
     *
     * If variable update rate is enabled, VHAL clients will receive 1 property change event
     * with value 1 at time 1s. VHAL may/may not send a property event for the initial value (e.g.
     * a property change event with value 0 at time 0s). VHAL client must not rely on the first
     * property event, and must use getValues to fetch the initial value. In fact, car service is
     * using getValues to fetch the initial value, convert it to a property event and deliver to
     * car service clients.
     *
     * NOTE: If this is true, car service may cache the property update event for filtering purpose,
     * so this should be false if the property is large (e.g. a byte array of 1k in size).
